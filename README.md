A safe haven for lab programs. 
This git rep is a desparate measure for desparate times. All students who, out of pure coincidence, happen to have lab programs aligning with the rep are welcome.

Note that the code in this rep may or may not be original. But hopefully, all of them lack adequate business significance to justify a lawsuit.
